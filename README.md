## Description
_This is a project I created for my B.S. in Software Engineering that takes an SVG of a world map and displays relevant information based on user clicks.  It is a single page application with the map centered on the page.   Clicking on a country will display the Name, Capital, Region, Income Level, Lending Type, and Coordinates.  Developing this application helped me grow my understanding of TypeScript, Angular, HTML, and CSS._
